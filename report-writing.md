## **Penetration Test Report**

### **Client**: \[Client Name]

### **Test Type**: Internal Adjacent Network Penetration Test

### **Date**: \[Test Date]

### **Prepared By**: \[Your Name/Team]

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

During the internal adjacent network penetration test, multiple vulnerabilities were discovered that could lead to severe compromise of the internal network. Notably, we identified a **Zabbix Agent Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability and an **SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation** issue. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary commands on critical systems.

### **2. Vulnerability Details**

#### **2.1 Zabbix Agent Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

* **Risk**: High

* **Vulnerability Type**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)

* **Description**:The Zabbix Agent is a monitoring tool that collects data from systems and sends it to the Zabbix server. A misconfiguration or an outdated version of the Zabbix Agent was found, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the target system. By sending a specially crafted request  attackers can run commands on the affected system, potentially gaining full control of the system.

* **Finding**: During enumeration, we discovered that the Zabbix Agent was running  ,by crafting malicious commands via agent , we successfully triggered command execution.

* **Impact**:

  * **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely.
  * **Privilege Escalation**: Potential to escalate privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities.
  * **Data Exfiltration and Integrity Compromise**: Attackers could steal sensitive data, modify configurations, or deploy malicious software.
  
#### **Remediation**:

1. **Update Zabbix Agent**: Upgrade the Zabbix Agent to the latest version to address any known vulnerabilities.
2. **Disable Remote Command Execution**: Set `EnableRemoteCommands=0` in the Zabbix Agent configuration file (`zabbix_agentd.conf`) to prevent the execution of remote commands.
3. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to the Zabbix Agent by allowing only trusted IP addresses (e.g., Zabbix Server) to communicate with the agent.
4. **Use Strong Authentication**: Implement stronger authentication mechanisms such as token or certificate-based authentication for Zabbix Agent communication.
5. **Audit Logs**: Enable detailed logging for the Zabbix Agent and regularly monitor for suspicious activities, such as failed authentication attempts or unexpected command executions.

#### **2.2 SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**

* **Risk**: High

* **Vulnerability Type**: Privilege Escalation / Impersonation

* **Description**:  Unauthorized SSH keys were added to a system via a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to impersonate legitimate users and gain persistent access to the system.

* **Finding**: We successfully exploited the system to gain a reverse shell and added our own SSH key to the authorized_keys file of an administrative user. This provided us with persistent SSH access, bypassing traditional authentication mechanisms.

* **Impact**:

  * **Persistent Access**: Attackers can maintain access to the compromised system even if passwords are changed.
  * **Privilege Escalation**: If the impersonated user has elevated privileges (e.g., sudo access), attackers can escalate to root and take full control of the system.
  * **Network Breach and Lateral Movement**: Attackers could pivot to other systems within the network.


#### **Remediation**:

1. **Remove Unauthorized SSH Keys**:
   Audit all `authorized_keys` files on the system and remove any unauthorized or suspicious SSH keys. Regenerate and rotate SSH keys for all users.
2. **Implement SSH Key Management**:
   Implement a proper key management system to securely store, distribute, and rotate SSH keys. Use strong passphrases for SSH keys.
3. **Harden SSH Configuration**:
   Modify the SSH configuration to prevent root login (`PermitRootLogin no`) and limit login access to specific users (`AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups`).
4. **Monitor SSH Logs**:
   Enable and regularly review SSH login logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`) for signs of unauthorized access or the use of compromised SSH keys.
5. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   Where possible, implement MFA for SSH access to add an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

### **3. Observations**

#### **Zabbix Agent RCE**:

* **How We Found It**:

  * We conducted network service enumeration and identified the presence of Zabbix Agent running on multiple internal systems.
  * We used a version scanner and found that the Zabbix Agent was running a vulnerable version.
  * By sending a crafted payload to the exposed Zabbix Agent API, we successfully executed arbitrary commands.

#### **SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**:

* **How We Found It**:

  * SSH keys were enumerated on multiple systems within the internal network. Expired or misconfigured SSH keys were found in the `authorized_keys` file for several users.
  * Using a combination of key extraction and SSH client tools, we were able to impersonate a legitimate user and gain SSH access with elevated privileges.

### **4. Impact Analysis**

#### **Zabbix Agent RCE**:

* **Potential Impact**:

  * Complete system compromise via remote code execution.
  * Lateral movement within the network by leveraging compromised systems as attack vectors.
  * Risk of data theft, system integrity compromise, or even full network takeover if critical systems are affected.

#### **SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**:

* **Potential Impact**:

  * Unauthorized, persistent access to internal systems.
  * Ability to escalate privileges if the impersonated user has administrative access.
  * Potential for lateral movement and further exploitation of the internal network.

---

### **5. Remediation Recommendations**

#### **5.1 Zabbix Agent RCE**

1. **Update Zabbix Agent**: Upgrade to the latest version of the Zabbix Agent to ensure all known vulnerabilities are patched.
2. **Harden Zabbix Agent Configuration**:

   * Disable unnecessary features (e.g., remote command execution).
   * Restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
   * Use strong authentication for the Zabbix Agent.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Implement segmentation and restrict network access to Zabbix Agents to minimize exposure.
4. **Monitor and Audit**: Enable logging and continuous monitoring for any suspicious activities related to the Zabbix Agent.

#### **5.2 SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**

1. **Audit SSH Keys**:

   * Remove expired or unused SSH keys from `authorized_keys`.
   * Regularly rotate SSH keys and enforce strong passphrase protection.
2. **Limit User Privileges**:

   * Follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only necessary users have access to critical systems.
   * Ensure sudoers files are properly configured and restrict elevated access to a minimal set of users.
3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for SSH logins to add an extra layer of protection.
4. **SSH Hardening**: Disable root SSH login and configure SSH to restrict access to only trusted IPs.

### **6. Conclusion**

The vulnerabilities identified during this internal penetration test pose significant risks to the security of the internal network. Immediate remediation is required to mitigate the impact of these vulnerabilities. It is critical to update and secure the Zabbix Agent, as well as audit SSH configurations and enforce stricter access controls. Implementing these recommendations will significantly improve the organization's security posture and reduce the risk of further compromise.
