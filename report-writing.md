## **Penetration Test Report**

### **Client**: \[Client Name]

### **Test Type**: Internal Adjacent Network Penetration Test

### **Date**: \[Test Date]

### **Prepared By**: \[Your Name/Team]

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

During the internal adjacent network penetration test, multiple vulnerabilities were discovered that could lead to severe compromise of the internal network. Notably, we identified a **Zabbix Agent Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability and an **SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation** issue. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary commands on critical systems.

### **2. Vulnerability Details**

#### **2.1 Zabbix Agent Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

* **Risk**: High

* **Vulnerability Type**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)

* **Description**: The Zabbix Agent, running on several internal systems, was found to be misconfigured or outdated, making it vulnerable to RCE. This flaw allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems.

* **Finding**: During enumeration, we discovered that the Zabbix Agent was exposed and running an outdated version known to have an RCE vulnerability. By crafting specific API calls to the agent, we successfully triggered command execution.

* **Impact**:

  * **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely.
  * **Privilege Escalation**: Potential to escalate privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities.
  * **Data Exfiltration and Integrity Compromise**: Attackers could steal sensitive data, modify configurations, or deploy malicious software.

#### **2.2 SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**

* **Risk**: High

* **Vulnerability Type**: Privilege Escalation / Impersonation

* **Description**: Misconfigured SSH keys allowed unauthorized users to impersonate legitimate users and gain persistent access to internal systems. These misconfigurations were identified in SSH authorized keys files on key systems within the network.

* **Finding**: By exploiting expired or forgotten SSH keys, we were able to impersonate an existing user, which granted us unauthorized and persistent access to the system. This could allow an attacker to move laterally within the network or maintain access even after other security measures are put in place.

* **Impact**:

  * **Persistent Access**: Unauthorized users can retain access to systems without detection.
  * **Privilege Escalation**: If the impersonated user has elevated privileges (e.g., sudo access), attackers can escalate to root and take full control of the system.
  * **Network Breach and Lateral Movement**: Attackers could pivot to other systems within the network.

### **3. Observations**

#### **Zabbix Agent RCE**:

* **How We Found It**:

  * We conducted network service enumeration and identified the presence of Zabbix Agent running on multiple internal systems.
  * We used a version scanner and found that the Zabbix Agent was running a vulnerable version.
  * By sending a crafted payload to the exposed Zabbix Agent API, we successfully executed arbitrary commands.

#### **SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**:

* **How We Found It**:

  * SSH keys were enumerated on multiple systems within the internal network. Expired or misconfigured SSH keys were found in the `authorized_keys` file for several users.
  * Using a combination of key extraction and SSH client tools, we were able to impersonate a legitimate user and gain SSH access with elevated privileges.

---

### **4. Impact Analysis**

#### **Zabbix Agent RCE**:

* **Potential Impact**:

  * Complete system compromise via remote code execution.
  * Lateral movement within the network by leveraging compromised systems as attack vectors.
  * Risk of data theft, system integrity compromise, or even full network takeover if critical systems are affected.

#### **SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**:

* **Potential Impact**:

  * Unauthorized, persistent access to internal systems.
  * Ability to escalate privileges if the impersonated user has administrative access.
  * Potential for lateral movement and further exploitation of the internal network.

### **5. Remediation Recommendations**

#### **5.1 Zabbix Agent RCE**

1. **Update Zabbix Agent**: Upgrade to the latest version of the Zabbix Agent to ensure all known vulnerabilities are patched.
2. **Harden Zabbix Agent Configuration**:

   * Disable unnecessary features (e.g., remote command execution).
   * Restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
   * Use strong authentication for the Zabbix Agent.
3. **Network Segmentation**: Implement segmentation and restrict network access to Zabbix Agents to minimize exposure.
4. **Monitor and Audit**: Enable logging and continuous monitoring for any suspicious activities related to the Zabbix Agent.

#### **5.2 SSH Permanent Access User Impersonation**

1. **Audit SSH Keys**:

   * Remove expired or unused SSH keys from `authorized_keys`.
   * Regularly rotate SSH keys and enforce strong passphrase protection.
2. **Limit User Privileges**:

   * Follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only necessary users have access to critical systems.
   * Ensure sudoers files are properly configured and restrict elevated access to a minimal set of users.
3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for SSH logins to add an extra layer of protection.
4. **SSH Hardening**: Disable root SSH login and configure SSH to restrict access to only trusted IPs.

### **6. Conclusion**

The vulnerabilities identified during this internal penetration test pose significant risks to the security of the internal network. Immediate remediation is required to mitigate the impact of these vulnerabilities. It is critical to update and secure the Zabbix Agent, as well as audit SSH configurations and enforce stricter access controls. Implementing these recommendations will significantly improve the organization's security posture and reduce the risk of further compromise.
